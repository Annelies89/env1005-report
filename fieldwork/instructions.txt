Upload your fieldwork data and reports here

Use this format for naming your file: DocumentTitle_YourNames_DDMMYYYY.filetype

You can add files in two ways:

1. click "Upload files", then drag and drop your file onto the page. Once it's finished uploading, go to the bottom and click
"Commit changes"
2. click "Create new file", then copy and paste the text of your document into the text box. Make sure you put ".txt" at the
end of the file. This won't work if your document has pictures or graphs.
