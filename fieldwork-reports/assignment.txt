After visiting the Parkietenbos landfill, use your observations and data measurements to expand your report that you started last week
with your findings from your field work this week.

    Make sure all your data is typed into in a google or excel spreadsheet.
    Calculate average measurements for each location (there should be several at the dump and several at the school, e.g. next to a
    burning pile, close to the trucks, in the courtyard, etc.).
    Discuss the observations you made while taking measurements.
    Discuss your findings:
        What do your numbers indicate?
        How do your numbers compare in the context of the international standards / normal levels?
