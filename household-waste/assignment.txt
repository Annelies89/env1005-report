The goal of this assignment is to get a glimpse of the waste produced in your households during one week.

Separate all your household waste by type, plastic, metal, paper/cardboard, food, hazardous (like batteries), garden,
wood and weigh each type then record it in this table together with your name and any noteworthy descriptions.

The report should account for all your household waste during a full week. We recommend doing the measurement on a
daily basis so it's more manageable and less nasty.

After the recordings just dispose of your waste using your usual method. 

The data will be used in the report you will work on.
