Make an environmental monitoring guide for one sensor including this information:

    Names of group members
    Parameter being measured
    Description of the parameter, what it's increase or decrease means and why it's important. 
    What are the standard values for this parameter? (use EPA or EU guidelines)
    Take clear pictures of the wiring of your sensor (and attach them at the end)
    Copy / paste the code you used to program your sensor.
    +10 points if you make a simulation of your sensor using https://www.tinkercad.com/#/?type=circuits (add a link)
    What were the values of your parameter at the University of Aruba? Take at least 10 measurements.
    How did you use the sensor?
    Describe how your sensor works.
